# ENEL300---Design-and-Build
# Interactive Frequency and Amplitude Modulation for use as a Teaching Resource

The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive game designed to educate students on the principles of low and high pass filters in an interactive manner. This is achieved by combining studentsâ€™ theoretical knowledge from lectures with a practical application within the game to enable learning of signal processing. Students will gain an understanding of low and high pass filters, and how resistor and capacitor values influence output. Through troubleshooting simulated problems, students will enhance their problem-solving skills by identifying factors that affect performance.

This Git repository contains the code (Arduino based), potential lab instructions, 3D printable housing unit and any working schematics and other information.
