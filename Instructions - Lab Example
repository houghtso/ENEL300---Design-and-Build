# Equipment
- Arduino (UNO or ENEL198 produced)
- Connector cable
- Circuit and housing unit ( or just the circuit and LCD screen!)
- Small flathead screwdriver or potentiometer screwdriver

# Game Setup
- Connect the circuit to the arduino (header pins are the same!) and place back in housing.
- Connect the arduino to a computer and download the file (from this repository) called "PUT FILE NAME HERE"
- Open up the Arduino IDE and then open the file (or open the file and it'll do it automatically!)
- Upload the code to the Arduino
- Yay, you have started up the game!

# Gameplay
The game is styled on Flappy Bird (2013), you need to decide which filter you would like to run by sliding the switch in the ciruit,
then adjust the potentiometer to the left or right to increase or decrease the height of the line, don't hit the block at the end!

# Scoring
The first person to 10/10 wins!
